## Usage
First a user must create a profile or sign in using their previously registered profile. On the welcome page, you will be directed to start a new game, which when clicked will take you to the game board.

Game play is classic Tic Tac Toe with Xs and Os alternating until a winner or tie is declared.

Additionally, users can restart the game at any time by clicking the button or are able to backtrack to previous moves by selecting the correct button.

Once finished, users are able to log out. 

## Contributing
My classmates Samantha Ahn, Brittany Brougher, and Nick Smith helped immensely as I used our final project for the skeleton code, including the server connections.

Tic Tac Toe game play was from the official React Tutorial at https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe.
